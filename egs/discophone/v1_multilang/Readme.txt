v1_multilang/ is developed based on v1/.
v1_multilang uses all 8 Babel languages and 5 GlobalPhone languages to train hybrid TDNN-HMM systems in a multilingual manner.

Main differences are:
1. ./run.sh modified 
2. ./local/setup_languages_multilang.sh added to add language-specific suffices to every word of each language.
